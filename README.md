# NiponABC

NiponABC website

## The project

This is a website for learning japanese alphabets specifically hiragana and katakana.

The main page consist of a game where you can practice the alphabets, the secondary pages consist of information about each alphabet.

## Development

### Technologies

- Next js:
  It is used for the webpage structure.

- React and jsx:
  They are used to create the components that will be rendered keeping in mind semantically correct HTML.

- Javascript:
  It is used for the game logic and to fetch and filter the data and its that the react components will be render.

- CSS:
  Used to style the website and to add animations to the components and the game.

### Challenges

- Design

  -CSS modules was something new to work with, I really enjoyed that each component could have its own styles.
  -Redesign for a more Ui/UX friendly website.

- Coding
  -The first challenge was learning and applying that knowledge to create a website and webapp with Next js, there are a few coding differences that I had to address.
  -Then the game logic itself is quite simple but getting everything to work together was the real challenge.
  -Creating a reusable component that is used in every page was something new that taught me a lot about reusable components.

### What I would do different if I do it again

- I would do smaller components trying to keep them as small and reusable as possible.
- I would do cleaner code
- I would add tests
